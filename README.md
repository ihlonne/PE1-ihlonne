## Overview

### The challenge

The goal of this project exam was to put into practice the skills I have learned over the FED1 program at Noroff Education (FED1 = 1rst year front-end development). I was to demonstrate my ability to interpret a brief, plan my solution, design a user interface, build and test a responsive web application. I was required to use all of the skills that I had learned this previous year including design, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### The brief

You have been hired to build a front-end user interface for an existing API blogging application. The client has asked for a responsive application that allows users to view dynamic blog posts. The client requires admin pages to register, login and manage their blog posts. During testing, you will use your own account that you create to act as the owner.

### Restrictions

- CSS or JavaScript frameworks are **not** permitted in this project. This includes Tailwind, Bootstrap, Vue, Svelte, React and similar packages.
- The project must make use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Code borrowed from external sources must be clearly marked with inline comments, including a link to the origin.
- One may use icon and font packs in the project.

### Client

I was allowed to create my own fictional client for this project, with a theme, backstory and branding of my choosing. I thought this was a good opportunity to show some of my interest and personality, and decided to go with a social media influencer who is passionate about knitting.

- **Name**: Knitting Casually
- **Sector**: Arts and crafts / Handicrafts
- **Size**: 1
- **Location**: Worldwide
- **Mission**: "Knitting Casually" is a blog dedicated to inspiring others to embrace the art of knitting by sharing practical tips, easy-to-follow patterns, and personal stories from the author's own creative journey. The blog aims to cultivate a welcoming space for both beginners and seasoned knitters to explore and enjoy the craft at their own pace.
